# üìä Admin Dashboard ‚Äì Full Stack Management System

In the past few days, I developed a full-featured system for managing administrative tasks, focused on performance, usability, and real-time data visualization.

The project was built using **React.js with Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, **Shadcn/UI**, **Recharts**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

### üß© Admin User Setup (MongoDB)

Before accessing the system, you must manually insert an admin user into the MongoDB collection:

1. Open **MongoDB Compass** and navigate to the collection:  
   `admP > admin > adminUser`

2. Click on **"Add Data" ‚Üí "Insert Document"**

3. Use the following format:

```json
{
  "email": "admin",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The password is stored as plain text (for demo purposes only). For production, implement proper hashing (e.g. bcrypt).

---

Now the system is ready to use!
